MG Framework list of known issues to be fixed/investigated
======================================================================

* MOs sometimes move on top of another MO.

* Creating large amounts of MOs can cause a crash.

* Moving large amounts of MOs can cause a crash.

* Hitting escape to open the console in the example application while
  saving console output to log file will result in input in console and
  output in log file. It bahaves as usual otherwise but is not very
  practical. One can easily mistake it for a crash since the prompt is
  not seen and the application crashes if you try to control the graphical
  window while in console mode.
