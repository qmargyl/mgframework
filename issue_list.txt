MG Framework list of known issues to be fixed/investigated
======================================================================

* MOs sometimes (very rarely) walk outside the map.

* Creating large amounts of MOs can cause free function to crash. This
  is likely due to lack of thread safety in the terminal server.

* Terminating the example application by clicking the top right X makes it crash.
