MG Framework list of known issues to be fixed/investigated
======================================================================

* MOs sometimes (very rarely) walk outside the map. Not seen for many
  months.

* Creating large amounts of MOs can cause free function to crash. This
  is likely due to lack of thread safety in the terminal server.

* Hitting escape to open the console in the example application while
  saving console output to log file will result in input in console and
  output in log file. It bahaves as usual otherwise but is not very
  practical. One can easily mistake it for a crash since the prompt is
  not seen and the applicatio crashes if you try to control the graphical
  window while in console mode.
